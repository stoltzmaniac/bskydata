# BlueSky API Data Wrapper

This is built as a wrapper for the `atproto` package. While that package is fantastic, it can be a bit tricky to navigate. This package will **hopefully** give a productive user experience.

### Installation
```
pip install bskydata

# Optional
pip install bskydata[azure]
pip install bskydata[aws]
pip install bskydata[gcp]
pip install bskydata[azure, aws, gcp]

```

### Examples are easy to follow in the "examples" folder of this repo
